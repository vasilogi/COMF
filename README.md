## Usage

All parts of this software have been developed, run and tested on Unix machines.

Run the bash script file `comf_run.sh` to automatically fit the experimental data found in `data` directory. The conversion fraction interval can be defined in `comf_run.sh` with the `blim` and `ulim` variables which indicate the bottom and upper limit respectively.
